# Microstrip Patch Antenna

This project involves the design, fabrication, and testing of a **Microstrip Patch Antenna** operating at **1.5 GHz**. The antenna was evaluated in an **anechoic chamber** to ensure accurate measurements free from external interference.

## ðŸ“¡ Project Overview

- **Antenna Type**: Microstrip Patch Antenna  
- **Operating Frequency**: 1.5 GHz  
- **Return Loss**: -12.24 dB  
- **Test Environment**: Anechoic Chamber  

The antenna was designed with the goal of achieving reliable performance in wireless communication systems operating within the L-band.

## ðŸ§ª Testing and Results

The antenna was tested in a controlled anechoic chamber environment to ensure precise characterization. The key metric obtained:

- **Return Loss @ 1.5 GHz**: -12.24 dB  
  This indicates acceptable impedance matching, meaning most of the power is radiated and not reflected back.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **Simulation Software**: [Ansys HFSS, etc.]
- **Fabrication Method**: [PCB etching]
- **Di-electric material**: [FR4 Epoxy]
- **Testing Equipment**: Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), Anechoic Chamber
